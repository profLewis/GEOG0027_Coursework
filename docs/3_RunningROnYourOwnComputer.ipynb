    "# Install software and files for modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup options\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `R` or `Rstudio`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways you can develop and run the modelling code we will be using.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the `R` software that you should be familiar with for the first year. If you need to refresh you memory with what you did in [GEOG0013, we provide the relevant files for you on moodle](https://moodle-1819.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=2712#section-4). Try to make sure you are familiar with loading `csv` files, basic graphing, and performing linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which option should I choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is probably easiest for you to use the `RStudio` environment for this work. First, this should be what you are familiar with. Second, it is convenient to use to develop codes and save the results as a report. Third, it is much easier to use with these notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the UCL Geography computers, we don't have `Rstudio`, only `R`. You should be able to use this, but it doesn't give you the fancy interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The options for software environments for doing this part of the work are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run `R` on the Geography UCL (Linux) computers\n",
    "2. Run `Rstudio` using Windows on [Desktop@UCL Anywhere](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/computers/remote-access/desktopucl-anywhere)\n",
    "3. Run `Rstudio` (or `R`) on your own computer\n",
    "4. Run `Rstudio` on binder\n",
    "5. Run `R` (via Python) on Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using option 1. is that you don't need to do anything other than come along and use the computers in the Geography Unix lab. Whilst there are ways you can access this remotely, it is perhaps not the easiest thing for you to do so, so if you intend working outside of the lab a lot, then consider another option. Also, you don't have access to `RStudio` in this option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Options 2-4 would probably be the best for you to consider. \n",
    "\n",
    "Option 5 is very neat, and involves running the codes in a notebook (this is a notebook you are using now!). But it is more complex to explain how to do this. If you are particularly interested in this sort of computing, we will help individuals to go through this route on request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 3 needs you to set up software. Options 2 and 3 need you to install data and code files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Option 4 has everything set up for you, runs in any browser (so, even on your phone or tablet), on an external server, *but* you are at risk of losing your work if you let the session go idle for 10 minutes or more, or if your session lasts longer than 12 hours. You can of course save and reload your work, but you have to be more careful of this in option 4. Also, option 4 takes a few minutes to get started, as it has to run a remote server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing R and Rstudio on your own computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 3 involves setting up `R` and `Rstudio` on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the packages you need for `R` and `RStudio`, follow the links below to download and install the software. Check it works by starting `RStudio`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Download and install R from https://cran.rstudio.com\n",
    "* Download and install RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing data packages\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best way (recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "A *preferable* way to do this, is to access these notes directly from `RStudio`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have started `RStudio` on any computer, start a new project:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ab1](images/ab1.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then select `Version control`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ab2](images/ab2.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then `git`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ab3](images/ab3.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill in the form, with:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Repository URL` as `https://github.com/profLewis/GEOG0027_Coursework.git`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Project directory name` as some suitable name you will remember\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "`Create project as subdirectory of:` somewhere suitable, e.g. `Desktop/GEOG0013`\n",
    "\n",
    "![ab5](images/ab5.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This will then download the `GEOG0027_Coursework` git repository. This has the advantage of containing all of the codes, files and notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have installed this, you should be able to navigate to the `GEOG0027_Coursework/docs/files` folder, and click on the icon for `GEOG0027_Coursework.Rproj` to start the `RStudio` session.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ab8](images/ab8.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Minimal way (not recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "For options 2 and 3, the **minimal** data/code requirement is that you install a few data and software packages. This involves downloading the file [UrbanModel.zip](http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/GEOG0027/UrbanModel.zip) and unzipping and storing it in your workspace (e.g. in `GEOG0027/gee`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In a terminal (shelltool), change directory to where your data files are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start `R` by typing `R` at the command line prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions in the Modelling section, typing `R` commands at the `R` prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Start [Desktop@UCL Anywhere](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/computers/remote-access/desktopucl-anywhere) in a browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start RStudio, and run RStudio as directed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Install R and Rstudio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start RStudio on your computer, and run RStudio as directed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Start RStudio by clicking the `binder` badge, and run RStudio as directed above: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/profLewis/GEOG0027_Coursework.git/master?urlpath=rstudio)\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To do this:\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "* Select all of the files you want to move (tick the check boxes):\n",
    "\n",
    "![upload4](images/upload4.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "* and move the files to the normal working folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "![upload5](images/upload5.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this will over-write the files in that folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "* finally, delete the (now empty) `rstudio-export` folder\n",
    "\n",
    "![upload6](images/upload6.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Do your work in `RStudio` as usual\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Save and download your session files.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* select the files you want to save (check boxes)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Under the `More` menu, select `Export ...`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* and save the file (`rstudio-export.zip`) to your local file system.\n",
