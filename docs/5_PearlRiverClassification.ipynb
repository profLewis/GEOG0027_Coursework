    "\n",
    "Along the way, you will need to do a manual classification (one supervised, one unsupervised) in `envi`.\n",
    "As a first step, we should *try* to quantify **at least three types** (urban, agricultural, and other) of land uses for each given year. A number of classification methods have been taught in this module, and Maximum Likelihood is a good starting point for multispectral TM imagery. There are also other image processing methods could help to identify land use classes (e.g. vegetation indices, filters, segmentation, etc.). Then, we can identify where changes have happened and how much land area has been transformed into urban built.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You then need to run an automated processing script [classy.pro](docs/files/classy.pro) in `envi` to apply unsupervised classification to the whole time series of data.\n",

    "For the modelling section of this report, it is **critical** that you extract a reasonable estimate of **urban** land cover for each year (it is not vital to do every year, but once you get started, this should not be too much bother). Agricultural land use should only be attempted if it proves feasible. If you do not believe it so, make a case in your report for not generating this cover class, and make sure you provide evidence to back this up. An acceptable excuse might,, for instance be that agriculture cannot be easily distinguished from other vegetation types in an annual dataset, but you would need to provide evidence of this. Also, some of the agricultural land use in the region is rice paddies, which might have rather similar signatures to other shallow water areas (if you want to claim that, provide evidence, e.g. spectra)."
