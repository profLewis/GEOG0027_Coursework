    "\n",
    "Following the general approach of [Seto & Kaufmann (2003)](reading/SetoandKaufmann2003.pdf), we will build a multi-linear model to attempt to describe the urban land use change per year (the 'y' variable) as a function of a number of key socioeconomic factors (e.g. capital investment, land productivity, population, wage rates, etc) (the '$x$' variables). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Equation 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = p_0 + p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 + + p_3 x_3 + p_4 x_4 + p_5 x_5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The model relates socio-economic variables (constant, plus `x1, x2, x3, x4, x5`), weighted by model parameters (`p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5`) to predict the rate if change of urban area per year (`du_dy`).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have taken a set of observations of `du_dy`, derived from Landsat land cover classifications for the years 1986 to present (or a subset). Along with estimates of the `x` variables from the Guangdong yearbook, we have then seen how to produce an esrimate of the model parameters (the `p` terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "This  forms the basis of the modelling section of this coursework: As noted above, you need to perform a model calibration, plot results, and describe **and interpret** summary statistics. Your interpretation of the statistics is vital here as it will show your understanding of the terms printed. Your plots should be neatly done, with full axis labelling, titles etc, noting any units or scaling factors used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Introduce the data and modelling task, referring to the contextual information in the introduction section (part 1), and the urban/agricultural area information from part 2. Introduce the ideas of calibration and validation to outline the approach taken here. [5%]\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the data derived above, calibrate a model that describes urban land use change as a function of a set of socioeconomic factors, following the approach of Seto et al. (2002, 2003). You are provided with `R` [code and appropriate datasets to achieve this](http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/GEOG0027/UrbanModel.zip).\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyse the statistics of the model and experiment to try to find an improved model with fewer parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write up the results of the modelling and your interpretation of the statistics [10%]\n",
    "\n",
    "We have given you a set of questions to help guide your statistical interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are then required to see if you can come up with a model with fewer parameters. The original model has 6 parameters, but it could well be the case that we can develop a more robust model with fewer parameters. One way we can judge 'better' here is to take a measure of goodness of fit that accounts for the model degrees of freedom: 'better' then is a balance of these things. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to perform additional experiment, with the expectation of higher marks, provided (i) you have done the basic requirements well enough, and (ii) you show clarity of thoiught and understanding of what you are doing in your experiments.\n",
