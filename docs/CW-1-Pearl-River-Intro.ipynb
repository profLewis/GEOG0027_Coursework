    "The project is most clearly phrased in two parts:\n",
    "    \n",
    "**1. Classification of land cover from a series of Landsat images**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, we need to quantify at least *three* types of land use for each given year, namely, **urban**, **cropland**, and **other**. In many circumstances, we would want to have cartegories of other as well, but this is not strictly necessary for this practical. Then, we can identify where changes have happened and how much land area has been transformed into urban. See example the land use change map below from [Seto et al. 2002](reading/Setoetal2002.pdf) as anexample of this.\n",
    " \n",
    "![seto](images/seto.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to be able to classify quite a large number of images, so we need to bear that in mind when considering what approach to take.\n",
    "  \n",
    "A number of classification methods have been taught in this module, and Maximum Likelihood is often a good starting point for multispectral TM imagery. There are also other image processing methods could help to identify land use classes (e.g. vegetation indices, filters, segmentation, etc.). However, if we need to apply training for each scene, the task soon becomes very tedious. We could try to use the same training data for each scene, but this might not work well across multiple sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we shall use a method of unsupervised classification (ISOdata clustering) to process the bulk of the data. This shifts the problem from one of large manual effort in providing the training datasets to a smaller manual effort making sure we interpret the machine-generated clusters appropriately. This is a basic trade-off of unsupervised versus supervised methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this work then, you will apply a supervised method and an unsupervised method to *one* scene, then assess the classification accuracy of your approaches. Because of the large number of images involved in the project, we will use an envi program (provided to you) to automate the process of unsupervised classification for the rest of the datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "After you have performed the classifications, you will process each dataset to estimate the area of urban land cover per year. Again, because of the large number of images involved, we will use an envi program to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Modelling Land Use change with socio-economic drivers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Having derived a dataset of urban land use, we can calculate urban land use change per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the general approach of [Seto & Kaufmann (2003)](reading/SetoandKaufmann2003.pdf), we will build a multi-linear model to attempt to describe the urban land use change per year (the 'y' variable) as a function of a number of key socioeconomic factors (e.g. capital investment, land productivity, population, wage rates, etc) (the '$x$' variables). \n",
    "\n",
    "Following the example in the paper, we will use the following in $x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $x_1$: Investment in capital construction / population\n",
    "* $x_2$: value of gross agricultural output / agriculture population\n",
    "* $x_3$: log(wages in non-state, non-collective units)\n",
    "* $x_4$: log(average total wage)\n",
    "* $x_5$: (value of gross agricultural output/Agricultural land) / (value of gross industrial output / Urban land)\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give a model with 6 parameters that we need to estimate (i.e. 6 unknowns) that we could call $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5$. We could then write the model more specifically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Equation 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = p_0 + p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 + + p_3 x_3 + p_4 x_4 + p_5 x_5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the final term ($x_5$) requires that we have data for Agricultural and Urban land, which we will need to derive from the remote sensing data for each year of observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the data will come from official statistics."
